                  The word family is one of the most loosely defined terms in
                  the English language; because it means something different to
                  everyone. While one person may define family as the relatives
                  who share their home, another may consider family to include
                  extended relatives residing near and far. Still, someone else
                  views their beloved circle of friends or their pets as family.
                  Families are vastly different, but they all function under one
                  single premise: shared love and commitment. The word family is

                  relatives residing near and far. The dictionary defines family
                  in several ways. One definition is "a fundamental social group
                  in society typically consisting of one or two parents and
                  their children." While this definition is a good starting
                  point, several modern family structures are excluded by this
                  definition, such as childless couples, friends as family, or
                  many other variations of the family unit. Another definition
                  is "Two or more people who share goals and values, have
                  long-term commitments to one another and commonly reside in
                  the same dwelling." Today there are many definitions of the
                  concept of family, and all are equally wonderful and
