                  The word family is one of the most loosely defined terms in
                  the English language; because it means something different to
                  everyone. While one person may define family as the relatives
                  who share their home, another may consider family to include
                  extended relatives residing near and far. Still, someone else
                  views their beloved circle of friends or their pets as family.
                  Families are vastly different, but they all function under one
                  single premise: shared love and commitment. The word family is

                  The dictionary defines family in several ways. One definition
                  is "a fundamental social group in society typically consisting
                  of one or two parents and their children." While this
                  definition is a good starting point, several modern family
                  structures are excluded by this definition, such as childless
                  couples, friends as family, or many other variations of the
                  family unit. Another definition is "Two or more people who
                  share goals and values, have long-term commitments to one
                  another and commonly reside in the same dwelling." Today there
                  are many definitions of the concept of family, and all are
                  equally wonderful and celebrated.
